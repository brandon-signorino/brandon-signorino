## About me

Data analyst by day, musician by night.

I have been doing data analytics in all of my roles since 2014.  I completed my MS in Data Analytics in 2023; since then I have worked in the field of institutional research, within the broader field of higher education.  I currently work at Butler University.  I am most comfortable coding in R and Python, but I have some experience with BASIC and SQL.

As for my status as a musician...
- I have one full-length record to my name so far. My former band Lavaborne (traditional heavy metal) released Black Winged Gods in 2021 via Wise Blood Records. Check it out [here](https://lavaborne.bandcamp.com/album/black-winged-gods).
- My current band Scorched Earth (groovy death metal) recently released a new demo titled Demolition. Check that one out [here](https://scorched-earth-metal.bandcamp.com/album/demolition).
